      Hi, my name is Fernanda Amancio. Law student in search of constant knowledge and new challenges. Currently going through a career transition to web development, specialized in frontend.
Due to the interest in visual constructions, I'm constantly learning about UX Design and building pages and platforms using recent tecnology tools and frameworks.
Captivated by foreign languaes, I also work as a translator and interpreter. The passiong for foreign cultures and processes of internationalisation led me to live in Canada and work in Spain. Currently based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
